# tackpad

tackpad lets you control a cursor using a touchscreen device. Like a trackpad!

# Dependencies
- flask
- pynput
- pyautogui (for getting the screen size. It's inefficient, I'll try to remove it)

# Usage

## Server Run `main.py`.
## Client Go to [your server's IP]:5000.

# Customizing You cannot customize it yet, though you can edit `public/main.js` directly to change the gestures.
