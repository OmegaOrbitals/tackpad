## tackpad

tackpad lets you control a cursor using a touchscreen device. Like a trackpad!

## Dependencies
- flask
- pynput
- pyautogui (for getting the screen size. It's inefficient, I'll try to remove it)

## Usage

### Server
Run `main.py`.
### Client
Go to [your server's IP]:5000.

## Customization
You cannot customize it yet as gestures are harcoded. Though you can edit `public/main.js` directly to change the gestures.
